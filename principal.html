    <h3>Dear All,</h3>
    <p>It is my proud privilege to be a part of IMIT, Cuttack. The college has a very good history and it has produced
        many brilliant officers, software professionals, managers, administrators and political leaders. The students
        are very disciplined and teachers are also very sincere. The college has a very good academic and working
        environment. The college was established in 1962 and is situated in Cuttack, the old capital city of the state
        of Odisha. I always believe in the principle of the Great Philosopher Aristotle who said “Educating the mind
        without educating the heart is no education at all”. I hope the students of IMIT will be educated both in heart
        and mind and serve the nation.
    </p>
